      <h1>Waterholing</h1>
      <p>
        A watering hole attack works by identifying a website that's frequented by users within a targeted organisation,
        or even an entire sector, such as defence, government or healthcare.That website is then compromised to enable
        the distribution of malware.

        The attacker identifies weaknesses in the main target’s cyber-security, then manipulates the watering hole site
        to deliver malware that will exploit these weaknesses.

      </p>
      <p>
        The malware may be delivered and installed without the target realising (called a ‘drive by’ attack), but given
        the trust the target is likely to have in the watering hole site, it can also be a file that a user will
        consciously download without realising what it really contains. Typically, the malware will be a Remote Access
        Trojan (RAT), enabling the attacker to gain remote access to the target’s system.

        Attackers are increasingly exploiting ‘watering hole’ sites to conduct espionage attacks against a host of
        targets, across a variety of industries.
