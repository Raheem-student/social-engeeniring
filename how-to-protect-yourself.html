          Cyberattacks are simply attempts to gain access or to damage a computer or a network system. 
          They can often lead to financial loss or the theft of financial, personal or even medical information.
          It is important to prevent these attacks as they can more often than not damage repuation and cyber safety.
          You can protect yourself using various methods of implementation of cybersecurity. This
          involves preventing and also detecting cyberattacks and then following up with a response.

        <ul>
          <br>
          <li><p>Limit what you share online!</p><br>
          <p>Changing privacy settings and avoiding the use of location features can help prevent cyberattacks. 
            If you watch what personal data you're putting onto the internet you can avoid any breaches. Keeping 
            software applications up-to-date can also help protect your data. Strong passwords with a wide range of 
            characters and symbols can facilitate this also.

            <br>
            <li><p>Use an anti-virus software</p><br>
              <p>An antivirus is used to scan, detect, prevent and delete viruses from your computer.
                Often when a virus is installed, it runs secretly in the background, an antivirus can detect these
                intrusions, alert you and then remove the malicious software and files from the system. 
              </p></li>
                <br>
            <li><p>Use a firewall</p><br>
               <p>A firewall is a network security device that basically monitors the traffic that is 
                 both incoming and outgoing on a network, it either permits or blocks the data packets based 
                 on pre-defined rules. It establishes a barrier of protection. Through analyzing data packets 
                 a firewall can be an extremely useful tool when it comes to cybersecurity.
